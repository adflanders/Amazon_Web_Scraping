# Amazon_Web_Scraping

Scraping Amazon for day to day price on item of interest (in this case, a Lenovo Legion 5). Using Pythons 
libraries such as Beautiful Soup and pandas to pull data from Amazon, and then format it into a cvs that updates daily.
Will be adding a function to send me an email when the price < 800.
